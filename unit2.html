    <h1>UNIT 2 - OUTCOME 1</h1>
    <div>
    <ul>
        <li><h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h3></li>
        <ul>
        <li><b>Site formatting</b></li>
            <p>I named the file for the home page index.html as instructed and saved this and all other pages in a folder named website. The font of the site is "Nunito" from Google Fonts and the text colour is rgb(66, 70, 66). Each page has a fixed floating navigation bar as a header at the top of each page to allow easy navigation through the website. I also insert a margin of 5% for each page and used a background image of white geometric patterns which allowed seamless transition if repeated and enabled the text to be easily read.</p>
            
            <li><b>Page 1 - Home Page</b></li>
            <p>The page starts with a tab title that reads HOME - MY CODE NATION BLOG followed by the navigation bar which I created using a flex box. This is then followed by another flex box that contains two boxes in a row, one containing a portrait and the other containing a brief about me section and welcome message. The site then goes on to inform the user of my background, my interest in tech and coding and why I chose Code Nation.</p>
            
            <li><b>Page 2 - Unit 1 - Outcome 1</b></li>
            <p>The page starts with a tab title of UNIT 1 - OUTCOME 1 followed by the navigation bar. This is then followed by the outcomes of my research of the objectives which also contains reference markers which are hyper linked to the reference page and takes the user to that page once clicked.</p>
            
            <li><b>Page 3 - Unit 1 - Outcome 2</b></li>
            <p>The page starts with a tab title of UNIT 1 - OUTCOME 2 followed by the navigation bar. This is then followed by the outcomes of my research of the objectives.</p>
            
            <li><b>Page 4 - Unit 1 - Outcome 3</b></li>
            <p>The page starts with a tab title of UNIT 1 - OUTCOME 3 followed by the navigation bar. This is very similar to the previous page and is just followed by the outcomes of my research of the objectives.</p>
            
            <li><b>Page 5 - Unit 2 - Outcome 1</b></li>
            <p>The page starts with a tab title of UNIT 2 - OUTCOME 1 followed by the navigation bar. This is then followed by the outcomes of my research of the objectives which again contains reference markers which are hyper linked to the reference page and takes the user to that page once clicked.</p>
            
            <li><b>Page 6 - References</b></li>
            <p>The page starts with a tab title of REFERENCES followed by the navigation bar. This page is dedicated to the references I have used while completing the objectives. Each link is labelled, titled and when clicked opens the links in a new, blank tab which increases the security of the new page.</p>
            
            <li><b>Page 7 - Main.CSS</b></li>
            <p>This contains all the design features starting with the text colour and box sizing . The next set of code is for the navigation bar which I chose to have slight opaque to enable the site to be seen underneath. Next is the flex box for the home page which contains the portrait and introductions and then the titles formatting which was simply colour and alignment. Finally I added the body formatting such as the background image, colour, size and alignment; font and margins. The final part of my CSS is I have classed the references as "ref" and coloured them all blue to stand out on the pages.</p>
            
            <li><b>Images</b></li>
            <p>I have two images. One is the background image (background.jpg) and the other is my a portrait (pic1.jpg).</p>
            </ul>
        <li><h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3></li>
        <p>When creating websites the constraints fall into two main categories: physical and psychological <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[8]</b></a>. Physical constraints are anything that affects the how the site works such as paths within the website that help you navigate through the website whereas psychological constraints as features such as symbols and mapping which also affect usability but are not physical in nature and more comes down to individual preferences when it comes to the interface. This is why it is crucial to ensure that use design flexibly to cater for multiple user who may have different hardware for example such as size of screen <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[9]</b></a>. There are also legal constraints such as copyright that need to be taken into account. This means developers must be careful to ensure they have permission to use any content they add to their websites such as images, text and audio <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[10]</b></a>. Failure to adhere to these legal constraints can lead to fines and even more serious implications for both the business and the individual. </p>
        <li><h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h3></li>
        <p>One of the main issues when using the internet is access for the blind. According to statistics in the US; two-thirds of blind individuals' transactions over the internet are abandoned due to their inability to access parts of a website <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[11]</b></a>. There are however some assistive technologies that enable blind users to improve accessibility. These include screen readers and dictators that convert the text on the website into audio and vice-versa as well as braille displays that convert the text into braille using a unique braille keyboard <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[12]</b></a>. Even thouogh these technologies are in place it seems from my research that accessability for the blind is still a major issue and certainly something I will consider and take into consideration going forward.</p>
        <li><h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3></li>
        <p>For the backend of the website, appropriate filetypes depend on what coding language you use. The most common are HTML for the structure of the website and CSS or Javascript for any the majority of the website features. For the content TXT files are ideal because they are a portable format between almost any operating system <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[13]</b></a>. There are numerous image file types that can be utilized which include .png, .jpg, and .gif <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[14]</b></a>.</p>
