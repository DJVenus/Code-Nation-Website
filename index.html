    <h3>My background</h3>
    <p>I began my professional career as a chef working in restaurants, bars, hotels and stadiums around the Greater Manchester Area. After 4 years in the kitchen I decided I wanted to continue learning and return to education. After alot of research I enrolled on, and completed, a BA in Business Enterprise in 2010 at Manchester Metropolitan University Business School. Since then I have worked in Administration and Data Entry roles using software packages such as Microsoft Office/Dynamics, Sage and Oracle and always particularly enjoyed using Excel and used a little Visual Basic coding. In most of my previos roles I worked have worked closely with the data departments and watching them code is what inspired me to learn more about coding.</p>
    <h3>My interest in tech and coding</h3>
    <p>This first introduction into coding, whilst working in my previous role, originally manifested into a new hobby that I'd do a little bit of on a Sunday afternoon. I immediately found Codeacademy and I began learning Python 2 with my first project being a pig latin translator. My research lead me towards Python due to it sounding the most user friendly for beginners as well as being relevant to roles I was familiar with such as data and database management which could enable better reporting. However, once I got started I found that these courses don't really help you prepare for real world scenarios and another barrier was that there wasn't much information on how to use my new found skills outside of the codeacademy software i.e. using terminals etc.</p>
    <h3>Why Code Nation?</h3>
    <p>While attending a zoom event in Novemebr 2020 hosted by Manchester Digital, I heard about Code Nation and the work they did and it sounded like an interesting opportunity. I looked into the courses and bootcamps through their expo section and the format of the training sounded ideal especially the introduction course as I was currently out of work and looking to retrain. However, after looking further into it I found that the prices were prohibative for me due to my current circumstances. Then luckily my work coach called me later two weeks later to inform me of an opportunity to join an open session for the 3 week introduction to software development course and I managed to secure a place and here I am at the end of the course and I have thouroghly enjoyed it.</p>
