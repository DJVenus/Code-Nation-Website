        <li><h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3></li>
        <p>My approach to how I used the IT tools available evolved as I progressed through the week and I gained more experience of using the software and various platforms. For example on Trello, I originally had a card for each question of the units objectives and started out using label tags as well as colour tags. However, over the week I developed a traffic light system instead with red for to do, amber for review and green for tested and completed which I found much clearer to follow at a glance and in turn increased efficiency. If the website had been custom and more complex instead of a blog for the assignment I think it's very likely I would have used a totally different system to improve the efficiecy of collaboration. </p>
        <li><h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h3></li>
        <p>I found that Visual Studio and Trello were ideal tools for this website project. Having never used software like this before starting this course, I have found Visual Studio to be incredibly easy to use and the ability to use multiple file types made creating the site very user friendly. Trello is a fantastic planning tool which enables teams or individuals to plan projects clearly and efficiently. Slack has also been a great resources for interacting with instructors and my peers and accessing the course materials and look. The IT tools I have been introduced to during this course have enabled me to progress so much more than I thought I was going to and really gave me a feel of what it would be like to work remotely in a IT role.</p>
        <li><h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h3></li>
        <p>Given the fact that I had no prior experience with HTML or CSS I am very happy with the blog website that I have created. I think it is easy to navigate around, the text and format is clean and flows nicely without being too boring in my opinion. There are no bugs or errors in the code and the UX has all the basic features I would expect if I was using a website such as a scrolling navigation bar, hyperlinks that open in new tabs and no missing pictures or broken links. However, given more time I would have liked to had the opportunity to apply some JavaScript to the website to improve the aesthetics and functionality but given my inexperience and the deadline I'm glad I didn't attempt it.</p>
        <li><h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h3></li>
        <p>Had I had more time I would of liked to have added some atmospheric audio to the website to maximise the enjoyment of the site. I would also have liked to include some sort of contact me function. However, I wasn't sure who would be accessing this site so thought it was less of a priority than some other features such as the flex box on the homepage which took me a lot longer than I would have liked to have figured out. Finally I would have liked some kind of graphic to replace the "My Code Nation Blog" section in the navigation bar. I think this would have brought alot to my website and really finished it off but I'd need to research how to use software such as Adobe Photoshop going forward.</p>
        <li><h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3></li>
        <p>A I have successfully created a blog website that contains the written outcomes of this project. The front page is complete with headings, titles, subheadings for different sections as well as a self portrait and a background image. All the references have been included with hyperlinks that open in a new tab with the homepage named as index.html. I have also created one HTML file per page which are all linked together in a root folder and can be accessed via a floating navigation bar which I have applied using CSS. I have also used CSS to create the flex boxes for the navigation bar and the image and introduction section on the homepage. Having gone through the outcomes I am happy that the website matches the requirements and is fit for purpose.</p>
