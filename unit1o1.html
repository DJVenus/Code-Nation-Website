        <li><h3>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3></li>
        <p>Information technology (IT) is an integral part of every single business plan <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[1]</b></a>. It can assist us in a variety of applications in business from improving communication with stakeholders to improving production efficiencies and can even help with budgetary implications by improving cost efficiencies <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[2]</b></a>. IT is so crucial to success in business today that research over the last two decades has shown that companies who choose to embrace and invest in technology, with innovation at the forefront of their decision making processes, increase their market share, financial figures and overall competitiveness <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[3]</b></a>. In summary I would suggest that the purpose of IT in modern business is to improve every facet of business and I believe we are now at a stage where modern business and the economy would crumble without IT.

        <li><h3>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – What do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h3></li>
        <p>Collaboration is crucial to the success of all work-based projects but it is particularly crucial when it comes to digital projects. Without a variety of methods, skills and resources; collaboration would be very difficult. The current pandemic has only increased reliance on these solutions. Trello is a particularly effective tool for collaboration that incorporates the kanban model in a web based platform that contains cards that you can assign tasks to into sections such as to do, doing, review and done. This enables digital projects to be organised and tasks to be delegated live in real-time which solves any geographical constraints as long as you have a computer and access to the internet. Slack is another great resources for collaboration. It allows users to share resources, send messages, share code, images and it even allows user to call each other. Again it is a live web-based platform so has all the connectivity benefits of Trello.</p>
        <li><h3>1.3 - Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. Making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h3></li>
        <p>Trello is a web-based, list making application that is free to use and enables users to list required tasks for projects and keep track of progress. It consists of boards that contains lists of tasks in the kanban style and each list can be assigned cards for individual tasks. These cards can then be delegated to specific people, given a deadline for completion, labelled for specific sections or have files or notes attached to them. There are many similar platforms with a popular one being teams which combines numerous features together but I didnt enjoy using Trello and would use it again. Below is a link to my Trello board for the website project:

        <li><h3>1.4 - Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h3></li>
        <p>Somewhere between 70% and 90% of digital projects fail <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[4]</b></a>. There are a variety of reasons for these failures from poor strategy to unrealistic goals but external risks are rapidly becoming the biggest problem when using IT solutions. Cybercrime is a common risk to digital projects; particularly when working on important projects or projects that involve sensitive data. Internet privacy is of paramount importance when working digitally and all team members need to stay vigilant towards these risks when working digitally. This is why workplace cyber security is vital in modern businesses with phishing in particular is a hugely popular technique designed to take advantage of low levels of user security awareness, accounting for a third of all data breaches in 2019 <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[5]</b></a>.

        <li><h3>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3></li>
        <p>The first criteria I would address when selecting and using IT systems and software is the budget for the project. As this was a zero budget project I choose to use Trello, Slack, Zoom and Visual Studio as they are free to use. Had I had a budget for the project I may have used paid services for example paid to extend the zoom call to avoid having to create new calls every 40 minutes. However, having used these systems and software's I found them very easy to use and had great features for collaborative work and would highly recommend them and will continue to use them going forward.</p>
        <li><h3>1.6 - Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h3></li>
        <p>Trello was a particularly useful tool as it allowed us, as a team, to monitor and delegate tasks live throughout the project and any changes or updates to the board creates an email notification which is especially useful for keeping track of progress and successfully complete the project on time. Slack was similarly useful as it enabled the team to share ideas and code via the messaging service as well as a great place to store relevant files such as learning materials. These two software's combined made collaboration very easy and they were 100% reliable and we had no user issues whatsoever. Visual studio also has great functionality and made coding much more efficient with its build in extensions and easy to use colouration and indentation. GitHub is helpful as it enables us to share our code which can be used to showcase my new found coding skills to future employers by linking it to my CV.</p>
        <li><h3>1.7 - Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3></li>
        <p>Along with budget, time and quality of projects, legal guidelines are the most difficult constraints teams face when working on digital projects <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[6]</b></a>. Since it's introduction in May 2018, General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR gives everyone control of their personal data and information. This is particularly important to companies working on digital projects as fines for not adhering to GDPR are anywhere up to 4% of the companies gross profit or €20 million <a href="references.html"><b id="ref">[7]</b></a>. This means it is of paramount importance that companies and employees comply with legal guidelines and constraints and it has a huge impact on digital projects.
