    <ul>
        <li><h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3></li>
        <p>I think the IT tools I have used lend themselves very well to both individual and collaborative projects. I think had I created a custom website for a particular purpose, the IT tools I have used would have been even more productive and efficient. For the purposes of this project they were very user friendly and each played an important role in ensuring that I was working as productively and efficiently as I possibly could have been. I think this project could have been done in teams especially if I had chosen to do a custom website as one team member could focus on content, another on HTML, another on CSS and possibly another team member on JavaScript which could have been organised and planned on Trello and Slack. In summary Visual Studio, Slack and Trello are fantastic tools to increase productivity and efficiency.</p>
        <li><h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3></li>
        <p>In retrospect, applying my new found skills, I would of approach this project by firstly getting the structure of the website down on cards in Trello from the beginning. However, as I was not sure what the website was going to be and how I was going to do it this of course wasn't possible. Being able to create the structure and aesthetics using HTML and CSS much quicker next time will also improve the productivity of the next project which in turn might enable me to research into some JavaScript functions. I have also got used to using shortcuts such as replace in the terminal which is starting to save alot of time. Finally, from an ergonomic point of view I need to invest in a desk and chair which would improve efficiency and productivity immensely as I'll need to take a lot less brakes once I'm comfortable.</p>
        <li><h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h3></li>
        <p>If I were to make a website again I would like the opportunity to try it as a team project as I think it would lend itself well to collaboration. As mentioned previously I think a team with each members' roles clearly defined would make the project a) a lot less stressful, b) would allow the team more time to learn the code and express themselves and add more functionality. The use of slack would of greatly contributed to the collaboration as we would have been able to communicate through it and share code and resources which again would of improved the productivity of this project. That is why I will be utilising these IT tools in any future projects and have enjoyed the opportunity to use them.</p>
        <li><h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h3></li>
        <p>As far as I am aware the only way to test the code is to manually go through it carefully looking for obvious errors that the software highlights and if there are any, correct them and repeat the process. The process can be both laborious but also very rewarding once you fix any errors. The success of failure of a website essentially comes down to testing and I have found its great to get other people, both coders and non-coders to test it to ensure it is 100% fool proof. A final check of compatibility for the different hardware's that the site will be accessed on such as mobiles, laptop and tablets will ensure the final outcome is as desired.</p>
